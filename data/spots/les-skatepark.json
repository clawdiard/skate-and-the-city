  "description": "Official concrete skatepark under the Manhattan Bridge. A well-designed mix of street and transition elements that serves as one of Manhattan's primary skateparks.",
  "history": "Built in 2012 by NYC Parks Department with significant input from the local skate community. Filled a long-standing need for a proper skatepark on the Lower East Side. Quickly became one of the city's top parks and a daily destination for Manhattan skaters.",
  "bestTimes": "Early mornings (before 10am) for fewer crowds. Weekday sessions are the most mellow. Weekend afternoons are packed. Avoid right after school lets out.",
  "transitDirections": "F to East Broadway (walk north toward the bridge). B/D to Grand St (walk south). The park is in Coleman Playground, directly under the Manhattan Bridge.",

  "detailedNotes": {
    "terrain": "Concrete throughout. The bowl section has pool coping and decent depth. Street section features ledges, flat bars, a stair set, and quarter pipes. Good flow between areas.",
    "culture": "Diverse crowd — from sponsored ams to weekend warriors. Respectful lineup etiquette is expected in the bowl. Strong local crew.",
    "warnings": "Gets extremely crowded on nice-weather weekends. Scooter kids can be an issue. The area under the bridge provides some rain cover but the park is essentially outdoor.",
