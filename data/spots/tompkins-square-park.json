  "description": "Classic East Village park with a longstanding skate-friendly culture. Smooth paths, varied ledge heights, and a welcoming atmosphere make it accessible for all skill levels.",
  "history": "Skaters have sessioned Tompkins since the 1980s, alongside the park's broader countercultural history. The East Village punk, art, and skate scenes have always intersected here. Despite periodic crackdowns, the park has remained one of NYC's most reliable spots to find a session.",
  "bestTimes": "Afternoons and weekends year-round. Summer evenings are prime social time. The park is well-lit for night sessions.",

    "culture": "Tompkins is more hangout than hardcore session spot. You'll find flatground practice, mellow ledge sessions, and lots of socializing. All ages and levels.",
    "warnings": "Parks dept occasionally enforces no-skating rules but it's rare. Respect the other park users.",
